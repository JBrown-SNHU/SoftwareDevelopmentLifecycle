CS-305 Software Development Lifecycle at SNHU

Question: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

By using epics and user stories; after listening to the request of a client, representing them in the form of epics and user stories allows the developers to not only understand ‘What’ the application needs to do but also helps them to understand the ‘Why’. Putting a face to the request allows the development team to realize it’s not just upper management asking to see a top 5 list of vacation destinations, but it’s a couple who just got married and want to book a wonderful vacation for their honeymoon to signify the start of a joyous life together. This help to put purpose and significance behind their work. 

Question: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

As I’m still in school now, so I am sure not whether I will work for a company that practices agile methodology, waterfall, or something else entirely. Regardless of what environment or methodology I am thrust into, I can choose to try and incorporate agile concepts into my own work ethic. By approaching programming with an adaptive mindset, I can position myself to better cope with change when it happens. I can do this by using aspects like the Daily Stand Up, to identify what I have done previously, what I am doing now, as well as what my fellow workers are in the process of doing. By making myself aware of these things, when change happens (whether it be waterfall or agile) I am aware of where we are in the current scheme of the project and can shift to help account for any changes to help the team recover quickly and keep moving forward.

Question: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe being a good team member in software development requires: 
1)	Doing your best at whatever your job is at the time. This includes practicing secure programming principles and patterns and learning from your mistakes.
2)	Being open and holding proper communications. This includes responding promptly to messages, being clear and precise when explaining yourself to prevent confusion, and being open to discussion, and correction.
3)	Make yourself available. This includes being aware of your team’s efforts as well as your own, and if you notice something that needs to be done, do it.
